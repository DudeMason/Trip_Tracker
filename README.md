# README

A little trip tracking app for where you're going on your trips and how long you plan to stay, as well as date setting, of course!

This was for a hackathon for school, which is where you make an entire app from scratch in under 6 hours. Whoever meets the criteria the best is deemed the winner!

We won.

NOTE: the backend has been cut off, due to the cost increase of backend services. The app will only store data in memory.
